**Duration:** Jan 2025 – Apr 2025  
**Institution:** Northeastern University  
**Role:** Project Lead | Data Analyst  
**Skills Used:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Time Series Forecasting, Matplotlib

## 🌍 Project Overview

This project delivers a deep dive into European air traffic patterns over a 9-year span, highlighting the effects of global events such as **COVID-19** and **Brexit** on flight volume, passenger trends, and airport performance.

We used open datasets from Kaggle, Eurostat, and ACI Europe to support airline strategy, airport planning, and regional policy development.

---

## 🧩 Objectives

- Understand the **pre- and post-pandemic traffic dynamics**
- Forecast air travel trends with **95%+ accuracy**
- Uncover seasonal patterns and shifts in airport dominance
- Evaluate business vs. leisure traffic and IFR (instrument flight rules) patterns

---

## 🔍 Key Tasks

- 🧹 **Data Cleaning:** Standardized over 300,000 records, merged multiple year-wise CSVs into a unified time series.
- 📈 **Time Series Analysis:** Built forecasting models (moving averages, ARIMA) for YoY traffic trends.
- 🛫 **Impact Assessment:** Quantified post-COVID recovery rates and Brexit-related declines.
- 🧭 **Traffic Shifts:** Identified major contributors to the recovery, including **low-cost carriers** and **regional airports**.
- 📊 **Visualization:** Created 20+ visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to communicate regional disparities and seasonal effects.

## 📈 Highlights & Results

- Achieved **95%+ R²** in modeling year-over-year traffic using historical trends and event-based adjustments.
- Revealed that **10 airports alone drove over 40%** of the recovery in passenger volumes between 2021 and 2024.
- Found a substantial shift toward **leisure travel** post-pandemic, with **business travel still lagging** in key hubs like Frankfurt and London.
- Detected **increased dominance of low-cost carriers** (Ryanair, EasyJet) in regions like Spain, Italy, and Eastern Europe.
